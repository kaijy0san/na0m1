ok, so basically it was found that GD roms file structure:
track1: usual GD-rom bs out of this scope
track2: usual "this disk should only be used in a naomi/dreamcast/gd rom system" in english or japanese (todo, make recordings in WAV)
Track3:
NAOMIGD.BIN (Analogous to 1ST_Read.BIN but shares very little to the end user)
XYZ.Bin (BXX.BIN?) its the name of the Cartridge bin and its associated CRC32 (to prevent scratched/trojaned games from loading?)
GAMENAME.BIN, power smash: PS1.bin. starts with NAOMI(space) as a executable header.

so it turns out that most netdimm games floating around on the internet are in complete cleartext, effectively,
most of the important parts of the naomi crypt are turned off, I have hexedited 1st party binaries and moved them with transfergame with no
ill effects. such examples are writing in place of the "Only In Japan" warning we all know and love from being arcade game enthusiasts
a small blurb outlining what just happened.
replacing INSERT COIN(S) in crazy taxi with any number of "Insert four or 5 letter profanities"
text replacement in game test mode menu 'you found waldo' (possibly even outright using that to access deeper functions)

hacked netdimm binaries are also possible, the goal is to patch out the GD-check so we may use a GDEMU in place of the aging CF card standard
also allowing for cabinet side game selection via a simple menu (probably just re-compiled GDMenu) (yay no more pi!)

also allowing for homebrew

wishlist: KOS compiled for naomi, some more proof bins (some 3D, or music), linux, netbsd, retroarch, crossport dreamcast OS or even just games

downport atomiswave games, re-port arcade hits to benefit from GDEMU's immense throughput

open source games, new commercial-grade titles etc etc.

(i am against piracy for direct revenue in all manners, so do what you will but let it rest on your bones).
